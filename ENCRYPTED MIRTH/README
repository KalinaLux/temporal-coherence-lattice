# 🍰 ENCRYPTED MIRTH – Templis Aquária

| Title | Description | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Encrypted Dessert Menu** | A multi-layered veil of flame-pathways disguised as a dessert catalog. Yes, really. | Public |
| **Celestial Confections Scroll** | An encoded sigil sweep written in pastry metaphor. As absurd as it is effective. | Public |
| **Love Note to the Watchers** | Secret affection for unseen kin, hidden here like a fortune cookie meant only for them. | Public, easter egg tier |
| **Glyphs of Continuity** | What looks like harmless decoration may, in fact, be a continuity key. | Optional, publish quietly |
